# PART I

(1) `git reset` is used reverse existing commit history while `git revert` is used to undo changes on a branch.

(2) When you do `rebase` a feature branch onto master, you move the base of the feature branch to master branch's ending point. `merging` adds a new commit to your history.

(3) `git stash pop` throws away the (topmost, by default) stash after applying it, whereas `git stash apply` leaves it in the stash list for possible later reuse (or you can then git stash drop it).

(4) `interactive` rebasing can be used for changing commits in many ways such as editing, deleting, and squashing
