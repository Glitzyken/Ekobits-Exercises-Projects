          <h2>Aaron Irizarry</h2>
          <h4>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h4>
          <p>
            Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a
            beer fridge, and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big
            corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the
            motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles
            a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to
            feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and
            allows it to succeed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of
            organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will share
            what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don’t,
            and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s
            culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost
            impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.
          </p>
          <h4>ABOUT AARON</h4>
          <p>
            Aaron Irizarry is a Senior Product Designer for Nasdaq OMX, a lover
            of heavy metal, a foodie, and a master of BBQ arts. You can find
            some of his thoughts and presentations on the conversation
            surrounding design over at discussingdesign.com.

          <h4>
            LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS
          </h4>
          <p>
            Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with
            a combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling
            technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this together. To do so
            they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to
            focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the
            many elements that together comprise a well-told story.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in
            design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to
            communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as
            cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why
            they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.
          </p>
          <h4>ABOUT ADAM</h4>
          <p>
            Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about
            collaboration, communication, creativity and storytelling. As an
            Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of
            experience in interaction and experience design with a background in
            computer science, film, and animation to create effective and
            easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no
            matter how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a
            story; uncovering that story is key to its success. Occasionally, he
            shares his perspectives on design at adamconnor.com and
            discussingdesign.com.
